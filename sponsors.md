**Semasio.** Serving some of the world’s biggest brands Semasio personalizes the digital marketing for every internet user by processing massive amounts of heterogeneous, unstructured data to produce tens of thousands of decisions per second, none of them taking more than 20ms. To achieve this means suspending the trade-off between volume, variety and velocity. Semasio does this by deploying state-of-the-art Machine Learning executed on new forms of hardware. The result is a qualitatively new paradigm in digital marketing – the first truly DATA-driven advertising approach.
